## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r}
#dependencies
library(data.table)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(cowplot)
library(lmtest)
library(sandwich)
library(MASS)
library(pwr)
library(stargazer)
```

###pre-experiment power calculation
```{r}
#assuming 50% effect size with 75 people in each group
pwr.t.test(n=75,d=.5)
```

we get .86 power which is sufficient and the number of people in each group seems reasonable based on pilot results

Generally, we can see that those who tend to consume more meat seem likely to lower their consumption after exposure to our panel content compared to those in the control group. And these changes could be more pronounced for panels A & C relative to control

### Analysis: Linear Model on Binary Outcome for Complier ATE controlling for baseline intentions

```{r}
#need to relevel to ensure placebo is base comparison
dt$treatment_1 = relevel(factor(dt$treatment_1),ref = "X")
#simple linear model on binary outcome (decrease or not) among compliers with baseline covariate
lm_fit = lm(outcome.binary ~ treatment_1 + base.intention.binary,
            data = dt %>% filter(both_correct ==1))
#using Robust Standard Errors
coef_tst = coeftest(lm_fit,vcovHC(lm_fit))
coef_tst
```


```{r}
#----Confidence Interval with Robust Standard Errors----#
ci95_low_vec = c()
ci95_high_vec = c()
for (i in c(2:4)) {
  ate = coef_tst[i,1]
  rbse = coef_tst[i,2]
  low = round(ate - 1.96*rbse,3)
  high = round(ate + 1.96*rbse,3)
  ci95_low_vec = c(ci95_low_vec,low)
  ci95_high_vec = c(ci95_high_vec,high)
}
data_frame(treatment_group = c('A','B','C'),ate_low = ci95_low_vec,ate_high = ci95_high_vec)
```

All panels have a significant effect on reporting a decrease in meat consumption compared to placebo after controlling for baseline intentions. For instance, Panel A increases reporting a decrease in meat consumption between 5 to 30 percentage points above the placebo with 95% confidence. So there's a net positive impact (if the aim is to lower meat consumption)

#simple linear model on binary outcome (decrease or not) among compliers with baseline covariate
lm_fit = lm(outcome.binary ~ treatment_1 + base.intention.binary,
            data = dt %>% filter(both_correct ==1))
lm_t1_t2_int = lm(outcome.binary ~ treatment_1  + treatment_1*treatment_2 + base.intention.binary,
            data = dt %>% filter(both_correct ==1))
anova(lm_fit,lm_t1_t2_int,test = "F")
```
Based on the F-score, we'd fail to reject the null hypothesis that the two models are the same, so we can evaluate treatment_2 independently of treatment_1


**Evaluating treatment_2 independently**

```{r}
#---looking at CACE for treatment 2 and outcome 2-----#
dt$treatment_2 = relevel(factor(dt$treatment_2),ref = "X")
#simple linear model on binary outcome (decrease or not) among compliers for treatment 2
lm_fit2 = lm(outcome.binary_2 ~ treatment_2 + base.intention.binary, data = dt %>% filter(both_correct ==1))
#robust standard errors
coeftest(lm_fit2,vcovHC(lm_fit2))
```

Here, treatment A appears to have the only significant impact with respect to lowering reported meat consumption. Treatment B is close, but we can see that its 95 confidence interval would include 0 in its range and treatment C is statistically not close to being significant. We may be seeing this change in effect between Panels when they're exposed first in the sequence vs second in the sequence because our compliance rate drops from sequence 1 to 2. Perhaps, respondents are losing patience or don't feel the pay is commensurate with the time effort

```{r}
#compliance rate when 1st question answered correctly
first = dt %>% group_by(treatment_1) %>% summarise(first_correct.compliance_rate = sum(read1_correct)/sum(!is.na(read1_correct)))
#compliance rate when both questions answered correctly
both = dt %>% group_by(treatment_1) %>% summarise(both_correct.compliance_rate = sum(both_correct)/sum(!is.na(both_correct)))
left_join(first,both, by = "treatment_1")
```


**panel effect after partialling out effect of other demographic covariates and considering heterogenous treatment effects**
```{r}
#other demographic variables
#simple linear model on binary outcome (decrease or not) among compliers
lm_fit3 = lm(outcome.binary ~ treatment_1 + base.intention.binary + age + gender + income + educ,
            data = dt %>% filter(both_correct ==1))
#summary(lm_fit3)
coeftest(lm_fit3)
```

Covariates don't seem to pass on any information that would help us better model effect on outcomes and there aren't any significant heteregenous treatment effects, except for panel B's effect on lowering meat consumption among high school students relative to college students. With that said, we'd expect this result to happen 1 out of every 20 samples so given that nothing else is significant i think this might just be a false positive.

```{r}
lm_fit3 = lm(outcome.binary ~ treatment_1 + base.intention.binary + treatment_1*age + treatment_1*gender + treatment_1*income + treatment_1*educ,
            data = dt %>% filter(both_correct ==1))
#summary(lm_fit3)
coeftest(lm_fit3)
```

For Regular Meat Eaters

#using Robust Standard Errors

Consolidating into stargazer tabel for comparions
```{r}
stargazer(coef_tst_regular, coef_tst_moderate, coef_tst_low, coef_tst_veg, column.labels = c("Regular", "Moderate", "Low", "Vegetarian"), suppress.errors = FALSE, summary = FALSE, type = 'text')
```

**Comparing whether or not some panels have a greater effect on lowering meat consumption than others**

```{r}
#Panel A as base
dt$treatment_1 = relevel(factor(dt$treatment_1),ref = "A")
#simple linear model on binary outcome (decrease or not) among compliers
lm_fit = lm(outcome.binary ~ treatment_1,
            data = dt %>% filter(both_correct ==1))
coeftest(lm_fit,vcovHC(lm_fit))
```


```{r}
#Panel B as base
dt$treatment_1 = relevel(factor(dt$treatment_1),ref = "B")
#simple linear model on binary outcome (decrease or not) among compliers
lm_fit = lm(outcome.binary ~ treatment_1,
            data = dt %>% filter(both_correct ==1))
#obust standard errors
coeftest(lm_fit,vcovHC(lm_fit))
```


```{r}
#Panel C as base
dt$treatment_1 = relevel(factor(dt$treatment_1),ref = "C")
#simple linear model on binary outcome (decrease or not) among compliers
lm_fit = lm(outcome.binary ~ treatment_1,
            data = dt %>% filter(both_correct ==1))
#obust standard errors
coeftest(lm_fit,vcovHC(lm_fit))
```

The only panel that is statistially significant when comparing the panels to each other is the placebo/control panel which is good to see.
